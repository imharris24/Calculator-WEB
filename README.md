A calculator is a widely-used tool that helps us perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Whether you're a student, professional, or just someone who needs to do some quick calculations, a calculator is an essential tool that saves time and reduces errors.

As a web developer, I've created a calculator using Bootstrap and vanilla Javascript. The calculator features a user-friendly interface and a range of functionalities that make it a convenient and practical tool for anyone who needs to perform mathematical calculations on the go.

The calculator includes all the basic functions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as advanced functions like square root, exponentiation, and trigonometric functions. It also has a memory feature that allows users to store and recall previous calculations.

The calculator is built using Bootstrap, a popular front-end development framework that helps create responsive and mobile-first websites. This means that the calculator is optimized for various screen sizes and devices, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

Overall, this calculator is a simple yet powerful tool that provides accurate and reliable results for all your mathematical needs. Whether you're a student, professional, or just someone who needs to perform quick calculations, this calculator is an essential tool that will make your life easier
